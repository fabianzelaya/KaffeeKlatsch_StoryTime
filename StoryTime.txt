1. Jack flew into the Flughafen in Berlin for a vacation. 
2. When he arrived, he saw a Rammstein playing music in lederhosen.
3. He was hungry after seeing the band, so he drove on the haupstrasse to try and find a baeckerei.
4. Jack found a quaint baeckerei and ate four delicious gebaeck.
5. Jack couldn't finish the final gebaeck, so he gave the last of it to his hund.
6. Jack's hund, Craig, ran out of the baeckerei and went straight to Eltz!
7. He was furious, he had planned to go to the Biergarten after but Craig had now ruined his plans by running away to Eltz!
8. Jack hiked up his lederhose and took off after Craig in the direction of Eltz, hollering at him to "Get right back here you hund!"
9. Jack lured the hund in with extremely fragrant Apfelkuchen he bought from the Baeckerei.
10. When the hund took the bait Jack lept out from the shadows and wrapped him up in dirndel he had found laying around in a local ratskeller.
In the Biergarten of Raesfeld, they found a vintage BMW that seemed to have its own stories to tell.
Suddenly, a mischievous Doener, trained in the art of Gebaeck theft, joined the group, adding a playful twist to their adventure.
